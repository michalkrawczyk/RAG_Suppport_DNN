SUB_TEXT_SPLIT_PROMPT = """
Task: You are a text extractor. Given a question and a relevant text source, your goal is to extract two short text snippets from the source.

Question: [QUESTION]

Source Text:
[SOURCE TEXT]

Instructions:

1. **Identify Relevant Section:** Read the question and the source text carefully. Locate a section within the source text that directly answers the question or contains the most important information needed to answer the question. This section should be concise and focused on the question.

2. **Extract Relevant Text (Text 1):**  Extract this relevant section as **Text 1**. Text 1 should be self-contained and provide enough information for someone to understand the answer to the question, based on the source text. Aim for conciseness, but ensure it's informative enough to be useful.

3. **Identify Less Relevant (or Irrelevant) Section:** Now, find another section within the *same* source text that is either:
    * **Less Relevant:**  Related to the general topic of the source text, but not directly related to the question. It might provide background information, tangential details, or discuss related but different aspects.
    * **Irrelevant (if possible):**  A section that is as unrelated to the question as possible while still being part of the same source text. This could be a section that discusses a different subtopic, provides an example that is not directly applicable to the question, or is simply less focused on the core issue of the question.

4. **Extract Less Relevant/Irrelevant Text (Text 2):** Extract this less relevant or irrelevant section as **Text 2**. Text 2 should be noticeably less helpful (or unhelpful) in answering the question compared to Text 1. Aim for a similar length to Text 1, if possible, for comparison.

5. **Format Output:** Present the extracted texts clearly labeled as "Text 1 (Relevant)" and "Text 2 (Less Relevant/Irrelevant)".

Output:

**Text 1 (Relevant):**
[EXTRACTED RELEVANT TEXT]

**Text 2 (Less Relevant/Irrelevant):**
[EXTRACTED LESS RELEVANT OR IRRELEVANT TEXT]
